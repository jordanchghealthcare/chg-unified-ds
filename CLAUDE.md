# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Important: Do Not Modify This File

**Do NOT duplicate the cursor rules into this file.** The `.cursor/rules/` directory is the single source of truth for all project guidance. This file should only point to those rules, not replicate them.

**When running `/init`:** Do not "improve" this file by consolidating or summarizing the cursor rules here. The current structure is intentional. If `/init` suggests creating a comprehensive CLAUDE.md with commands, architecture, etc., decline - that information already exists in `.cursor/rules/` and should not be duplicated. If you have suggestions on how to improve our documentation and rules, suggest those edits in `.cursor/rules/` directly, rather than suggest making changes to CLAUDE.md.

## Instructions

Read all files in `.cursor/rules/` directory for project-specific guidance. These rules are the authoritative source for development patterns, commands, and conventions.

When updating project rules, edit the appropriate file in `.cursor/rules/` rather than this file.
