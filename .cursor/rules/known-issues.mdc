# Known Issues

## Tailwind CSS 4 + Storybook HMR

**New components require a Storybook restart.** Tailwind CSS 4's HMR doesn't always detect utility classes in newly created component files. If a new component appears unstyled (no colors, looks like wireframes), restart Storybook:

```bash
pkill -f "storybook dev"
npm run dev
```

This only affects new files - edits to existing components work fine with HMR.

## Token Issues

Token issues are tracked in `tokens/TOKEN-ISSUES.md`. Current known issues:
- Self-referencing radius aliases (workaround in place)
- Empty brand-specific token files (brand colors available in Primitives file)

Run `npm run validate:tokens` after updating tokens to check for issues.

## DotStatus / Avatar Integration

**Code diverges from Figma design in two areas:**

1. **Missing `lg` size in Figma**: DotStatus in code has a `lg` (16px) size variant that doesn't exist in Figma. This was added to support Avatar's large size status indicator.

2. **Border color override**: DotStatus uses `ring-gray-200` for its border, but Avatar's status indicator needs `ring-base-white` to match the original design. Avatar overrides this via className.

These should be synced with the Figma design system when possible.
